#Facet grids in Seaborn allow you to create a grid of subplots based on the values of one or more categorical variables. This is particularly useful for visualizing relationships in your data across different categories.
#Facet grids consist of multiple small plots, each representing a subset of the data based on specified conditions. Seaborn's FacetGrid class provides a way to create and organize these grids. Let's introduce the concept with a simple example using the "tips" dataset:

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the "tips" dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create a Facet Grid based on the "time" variable
facet_grid = sns.FacetGrid(tips, col="time")

# Map a scatter plot to the grid
facet_grid.map(plt.scatter, "total_bill", "tip")
plt.show()

# In this example:

# The FacetGrid is created with the "time" variable, resulting in two columns: one for lunch and one for dinner.
# The map() function is used to plot a scatter plot of "total_bill" against "tip" for each time category.




#Facet grids shine when you want to create multiple plots based on additional variables. Let's create a Facet Grid with multiple plots based on both "time" and "day" variables:

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the "tips" dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create a Facet Grid based on "time" and "day"
facet_grid = sns.FacetGrid(tips, col="time", row="day")

# Map a scatter plot to the grid
facet_grid.map(plt.scatter, "total_bill", "tip")
facet_grid.add_legend()
plt.show()


# The FacetGrid is created with both "time" and "day" variables, resulting in a grid of plots organized by both categories.
# The map() function is used to plot a scatter plot of "total_bill" against "tip" for each combination of time and day.
# add_legend() is used to add a legend to the grid.
